# (Temporary) Project Ideas - Found in Logistics .pdf
## Just some ones I found interesting / probably attainable

6) Being able to predict cpu/mem/disk load of 
database machines can enable 
”consolidation”, i.e., the co-location of
multiple DB within a smaller set of physical 
servers. The project would consist in 
investigating machine-learning and other 
predictive techniques.

8) Often database assume data to be stored on a 
local disk, however data stored on network 
file systems can allow for easier 
administration, and is rather common in 
enterprises. The project will investigate the 
impact of local-vs-networked storage on 
query performance.

9) Twitter provides a fire hose of data. 
Automatically filtering, aggregating, 
analyzing such data can allow a way to 
harness the full value of the data, extracting
valuable information. The idea of this project 
is investigating stream processing technology 
to operate on social streams.
